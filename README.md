# Audio-Synced-Frame-Transparency-Tool
Look into Audio-Frequency-Sampler-for-Video-Effects for a more polished tool that has the same capabilities and samples frequency. This has far less complexity so it can be easier to get better results, but lacks detail due to it's limitations.

Made this for some animations I made to sync visual affects to music by adjusting the alpha values of video frames variably based on the wave data of a sound file after some filtering to guide the results.

Only accepts (.wav) sound files, frames must be in (.jpg) or (.png) format. Frames must be named numerically in suffix, ex.(abc0001.png).
Results vary greatly so you may want to use something like Audacity to enhance the qualities you want
