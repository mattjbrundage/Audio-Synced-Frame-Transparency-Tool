# audio-synced-frame-transparency
Audio-synced video frame transparency tool \n
Made this for some animations I made to sync visual affects to music \n
Only accepts (.wav) sound files, frames must be in (.jpg) or (.png) format. Frames must be named numerically in suffix, ex.(abc0001.png). \n
Results vary greatly so you may want to use something like Audacity to enhance the qualities you want
